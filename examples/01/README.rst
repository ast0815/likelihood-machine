--------------------------
Building a response matrix
--------------------------

Aims
====

*   Use simulated events to build detector response matrix
*   Test the model-independence of the matrix
*   Optimise the binning

Instructions
============

A response matrix describes the probabilities of true events to be reconstructed
as with different recosntructed properties. The definitions of the truth and reco bins
is taken from the binnings used in the previous example:
